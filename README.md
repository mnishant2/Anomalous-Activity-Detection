
# PHYSICAL INTRUSION DETECTION

## testing
1.Copy pcalik.save file in code folder to your python2 present working directory. The pcalik file contatains all the extracted and decomposed features for training and test data
You can find pcalik.save [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5ml98STOia8T1d4cjI3Q3pFQTA/view?usp=sharing)
2.Copy model_activity_400_7.h5 to your python2 present working directory
3.Open final_gui.py
4.execute final_gui,select video for testing(given in Test Data folder)
5.Double Click accordingly to RUN, PAUSE or STOP the video.

## future development and updation of neural parameters
6.You can extract you own features from a new dataset using feature_extraction.py
7.You can create Own neural Network for using SIH_Neural_Net.py,new pcalik.save and model_activity_400_7.h5 files will be created.
